# spamfilter-using-ml-in-python

I have used the data set for spam from the link (http://untroubled.org/spam/)
And for the ham i used my own data set from my personal gmail account.
And the extraction of mails from the gmail account provided here.

And used the most popular machine learning for spam classification that is Naive bayes.



And the classifier got me accuracy of around 98%, with a small data set of about 5000.
